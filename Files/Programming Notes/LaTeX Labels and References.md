# LaTeX Labels and References

`\label{}` This will add an invisible label to any item like so:

```latex
\section{Lists\label{List}}
\item Butter \label{butter}
```


`\ref{}` This is the number of the referenced label if its the 3rd item then it will display only a '3'
`(\ref{})` The same as above but wrapped in parens
