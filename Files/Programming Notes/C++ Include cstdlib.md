The [C Standard Library](http://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/) contains many standard general utilities for `C`.

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
```

## Pseudo-random sequence generation

### rand

Returns a pseudo-random integral number in the range between 0 and `RAND_MAX`.

This number is generated by an algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers each time it is called. This algorithm uses a seed to generate the series, which should be initialized to some distinctive value using function `srand`.

`RAND_MAX` is a constant defined in `<cstdlib>`.

A typical way to generate trivial pseudo-random numbers in a determined range using rand is to use the modulo of the returned value by the range span and add the initial value of the range:
	
```cpp
v1 = rand() % 100;         // v1 in the range 0 to 99
v2 = rand() % 100 + 1;     // v2 in the range 1 to 100
v3 = rand() % 30 + 1985;   // v3 in the range 1985-2014
```

### srand

The pseudo-random number generator is initialized using the argument passed as seed.

For every different seed value used in a call to `srand`, the pseudo-random number generator can be expected to generate a different succession of results in the subsequent calls to `rand`.

Two different initializations with the same seed will generate the same succession of results in subsequent calls to `rand`.

If seed is set to 1, the generator is reinitialized to its initial value and produces the same values as before any call to rand or `srand`.

In order to generate random-like numbers, `srand` is usually initialized to some distinctive runtime value, like the value returned by function time (declared in header `<ctime>`). This is distinctive enough for most trivial randomization needs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
     printf ("First number: %d\n", rand()%100);
    
     srand (time(0));
    
     printf ("Random number: %d\n", rand()%100);
     srand (1);
     printf ("Again the first number: %d\n", rand()%100);

    return 0;
}
```
